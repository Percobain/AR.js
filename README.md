# Augmented Reality 3D Logo with QR Code

This project demonstrates how to create an augmented reality experience using AR.js and a 3D model. The experience is accessed by scanning a QR code that directs users to the AR application.

## Idea Overview

The concept behind this project is inspired by [Jelena Ristic's article](https://jelena-ristic.medium.com/how-to-create-an-augmented-reality-3d-logo-with-blender-and-ar-js-1d7097456eb0). In her tutorial, Jelena outlines the process of creating a 3D logo using Blender and integrating it into a web-based AR application using AR.js. 

This project showcases how users can interact with a 3D model in augmented reality simply by scanning a QR code. The QR code links to an AR application that can be accessed from a mobile device or any compatible screen.

## How to Use

To experience the augmented reality 3D logo, follow these steps:

1. **Open the QR Code**: Use another laptop, mobile device, or screen to display the QR code. You can do this by opening the image of the QR code provided above.

2. **Access the AR Application**:
   - Open your phone's web browser.
   - Navigate to the following URL: [https://ar-theta-ten.vercel.app/](https://ar-theta-ten.vercel.app/).

3. **Scan the QR Code**:
   - Point your mobile device's camera at the displayed QR code on the other screen.
   - The AR application will launch, and you should see the 3D logo rendered in augmented reality.
